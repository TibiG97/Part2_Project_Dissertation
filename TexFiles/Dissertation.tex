\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my supervisor, Dr Lucian Carata, for his patient and persistent guidance, encouragement and advice provided throughout my time working for this project. I would also like to thank my Director of Studies, Dr John Fawcett, for his help and support during my entire undergraduate degree. Finally, this project and student journey would have not been possible without the emotional support of my family and my girlfriend, who have always encouraged me in all my pursuits.

\section*{Original aims of the project}

The original aim of the project was to give a solution to the problem of files created either by users or processes which end up having unintuitive or non-descriptive names. The core goal of the project was to implement a machine learning pipeline capable of classifying files in terms of both their content and context (graphs representing provenance data) information. Afterwards, using these results and a user-given policy, the project should suggest a way of renaming files and firstly present it to the user (as opposed to directly intervening to them).

\section*{Work completed}
I have implemented a ML pipeline comprised of four main components: a content classification pipeline (for which I use a novel graph classification algorithm alongside a convolutional neural network), a log files content classification pipeline (for which I use a couple of preprocessing techniques alongside a multilayer perceptron), a stacked ensemble classifier (a meta-classifier which combines the predictions from the previous two in order to return the final, overall, predictions) and a rule based renaming procedure. As an extension, I use two off-the-shelf implementations of popular classifiers, as baselines for my context classification pipeline in a comparative analysis. 

\section*{Special Difficulties}
None.
